## Overview of FitFlow

![Application Overview](images/ApplicationOverview.png)

When you first open the app, this is what you will see. There are **three** key elements in the application.

1. The Textbox. This is where you would be typing all your commands in the application
2. The Output Box. This is where the application will reply to you, based on your commands
3. The Client List. You will be able to view the basic information of the client you have saved.

You will realise that there are some clients already pre-loaded with data. This is done so that you can get a feel for the app. You will be able to remove these entries using the `clear` command later on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting started

Let's try out some basic commands to get a feel for how the app works!

1. Try typing `find roy` in the Textbox and hit Enter.

    You will see that the Client List now shows you Roy Balakrishnan at index 1. The `find` command is helpful for quickly finding someone in your client list.

2. To see all the clients again, type `list` in the Textbox and hit Enter.

    You can now see all the current clients in the Client List. You can also scroll down on the list to see more clients.

You may have noticed that there are not many details being shown in the Client list. This is to keep the details shown simple and easy on the eyes.

To see the full details of a client, try the following.

1. Type `display 1` in the Textbox and hit Enter.

    You can now see that Alex Yeoh's full details are displayed in the Output Box. You can try `display` with the other indexes currently shown in the client list to see the details of other clients.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** `display` works with the indexes in the current Client List. This means you can do `find irfan` then `display 1` to quickly see the details of Irfan!
</div>

For more information on the commands used in this section, check them out in our User Guide.

**FitFlow is a new application, designed for Singaporean personal trainers.** While it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using FitFlow, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you would like a step-by-step guided tutorial in using FitFlow, head over to the [**Guided Tutorial**](GuidedTutorial.html).
* If you are interested about developing FitFlow, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
